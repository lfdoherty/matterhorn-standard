'Matterhorn' is a means for composing web application modules built using node.js and the express framework,
and a collection of such modules.

*****

This package is a wrapper around the client-side versions of:
- the dust templating engine: http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/
- jquery: http://jquery.com/
- qtip: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
- seedrandom: http://davidbau.com/archives/2010/01/30/random_seeds_coded_hints_and_quintillions.html
- underscore: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/

with some additional functionality for AJAX and some additional functions in the underscore namespace.

The purpose of this package is to package these libraries in the manner required by the Matterhorn framework.
